# Awesome Javascript

Some-awe-some pieces of javascript code that I have made with the sole purpose of learning javascript and becoming better in development a step at a time.


### 1. [Basic Calculator](https://github.com/namantw/Awesome-Javascript/blob/master/basic-calculator.html)

A cool calculator made using pure Javascript, HTML and CSS.

### 2. [Paint](https://github.com/namantw/Awesome-Javascript/blob/master/paint.html)

A fun painting tool made with the HTML5 canvas element.
